# HOTDOG-NOTHOTDOG

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model to classify images as either "hotdog" or "not hotdog". The project is inspired by the popular "Hotdog Not Hotdog" app from the TV show *Silicon Valley*.

## Introduction

The "Hotdog Not Hotdog" app is a fun way to demonstrate image classification using deep learning. This project aims to replicate that concept using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images as either containing a hotdog or not.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Load the Model**: First, load the pre-trained model.
2. **Predict on New Data**: Use the model to predict whether an image contains a hotdog or not.



## Model Details

The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a dataset of hotdog and non-hotdog images. The architecture of the model is based on [VGG16](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556), which is known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks.
